A Thirukkural teller - NLP using Tensorflow

* I still remember my childhood days where my tamil subject will have this section. Either they will give the first word or the last word of the thirukkural as question and we have to complete the rest. Actually its not easy to remember ***1330*** of them where each have seven words. They do have definite meaning but still its quite difficult for me to relate the meaning with the words. 

* Ok coming to the technical part, initially I have web-scraped all the 1330 thirukkural from an online website - [Project Madurai](https://www.projectmadurai.org/pm_etexts/utf8/pmuni0001.html). Then I have tokenized all the 1330*7 words and trained their token sequence using deep learning. LSTM is used to transport memory to the next state. I know, literally I am gonna test with the training data, so obviously its accuracy will be high.

* I just followed the Tensorflow in practice specialization from coursera and did this project from what I have learnt there.
